# Charging Station Simulator

The Charging Station Simulator is a server-side application that emulates the charging process for electric vehicles. It is specifically designed to be used by the server, enabling it to simulate the charging experience without requiring any user interaction.

## Features

- Simulates the charging process for electric vehicles.
- Provides an accurate representation of various charging stages.
- Calculates the associated costs based on the charging percentage and pricing parameters.
- Enhances the server's capabilities in managing and monitoring charging activities.

## How It Works

The Charging Station Simulator operates as a backend application that runs on the server. It is responsible for simulating the charging process and generating the necessary data and calculations related to the charging activities.

The simulator receives inputs such as the charging percentage and the pricing parameters set by the station owner. Based on these inputs, it emulates the actions involved in charging and determines the associated costs. This information is then made available to the server for further processing or display.

## Getting Started

To use the Charging Station Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your server.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the simulator based on your specific needs, such as pricing parameters.
4. Integrate the simulator with your existing server infrastructure.
5. Ensure the simulator is running and accessible to your server.

## Usage

The Charging Station Simulator operates as a backend service and does not have a user interface. It is meant to be utilized by the server to simulate charging processes and calculate associated costs.

To integrate the simulator with your server, use the provided API or implement direct function calls to initiate charging simulations and retrieve the results.
